- Primary color: A vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to convey trust and reliability.
- Background color: A light gray (#F5F5F5) to ensure the button and input field stand out.
- Accent color: A complementary teal (#008080) for interactive elements like the submit button, creating a visual cue for the user.
- Font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif to ensure readability of the phone number input and confirmation messages.
- Use a simple, recognizable phone icon for the floating button.
- The phone button should be positioned in a corner of the screen and remain fixed during scrolling.
- Subtle animation on button press and message display, such as a fade-in effect.
